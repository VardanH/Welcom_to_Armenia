</h2>

<div class="row ">
<div class="col-*-* col-*-offset-2">
<ul>
<li class="text-left">It is located in the <strong>Alps-Himalayas gosincline</strong> almost in the center
      of it and has no marine borders,<br/> the territory of the republic is
      located 165 km from the Black Sea, from the Caspian Sea 190 km,<br/>
      from the Mediterranean Sea - 750 km, and from the Persian Gulf 
      more than 1000 km.
</li>


<li class="text-left"> The Republic of Armenia is the first state in the world that adopt Christianity as a state religion <strong>(301 y. )</strong>.
</li>
<li class="text-left"> The highest point is the northern peak of Mount Aragats <strong>4090
m</strong>, and the lowest stations are located in<br/> the Debed Valley (Bagratashen village) and the bottom
in the south-east, 375m in the Arax valley. Let's<br/> add that the surface is <strong>40%
Located at a height of more than 2000 m</strong>.</li>
<li class="text-left"><strong>82%</strong> of the area is volcanic mountain slopes isolatedvolcanic cone mounds, folding mountain ranges,<br/> and only <strong>18%</strong> of the plains,which, without exception, are at altitudes above <strong>500 m.</strong></li>
<li class="text-left"> The capital of the Republic of Armenia, Yerevan (Erebuni), was founded by Argishti I, the son of King<br/> Menua,  Almost <strong>2800</strong> years ago in 782 BCE.
</li>
<li class="text-left"> The original native Armenian name for the country was <strong>Հայք (Hayq)</strong>, however it is currently rarely used.</li>
<li class="text-left"> The name has traditionally been derived from Hayq (Հայկ), the legendary patriarch of the Armenians<br/> and a great-great-grandson of <strong>Noah</strong>, who, according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene,<br> defeated the Babylonian king Bel  and established his nation in the Ararat region</li>
<li class="text-left"> The exonym <strong>Armenia</strong> is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription (515 BC) as Armina . The<br/> Ancient Greek terms Ἀρμενία (Armenía) and Ἀρμένιοι (Arménioi, "Armenians") are first mentioned by<br/> Hecataeus of Miletus (c. 550 BC – c. 476 BC). Xenophon, a Greek general serving in some of the Persian<br/> expeditions, describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality.</li>
<li class="text-left"> Armenia lies in the highlands surrounding the mountains of Ararat. There is evidence of an early <br/>civilisation in Armenia in the Bronze Age and earlier, dating to about <strong>4000 BC</strong>. Archaeological surveys in<br/> 2010 and 2011 at the Areni-1 cave complex have resulted in the discovery of the world's earliest known<br/> leather shoe, skirt, and wine-producing facility</li>
<li class="text-left">The Temple of Garni (Armenian: Գառնու տաճար, Gaṙnu tačar, [ˈgɑrnu ˈtɑtʃɑʁ])[a] is the <strong>only standing</strong> <br/> Greco-Roman colonnaded building in Armenia and the former Soviet Union. An Ionic temple located<br/> in the village of Garni, Armenia, it is the best-known structure and symbol of pre-Christian Armenia.<br/>
The structure was probably built by king Tiridates I in the first century AD as a temple to the sun god<br/> Mihr. After Armenia's conversion to Christianity in the early fourth century, it was converted into a royal<br/> summer house of Khosrovidukht, the sister of Tiridates III. According to some scholars it was not a<br/> temple but a tomb and thus survived the universal destruction of pagan structures. It collapsed in a 1679<br/> earthquake. Renewed interest in the 19th century led to excavations at the site in early and mid-20th <br/>century and its eventual reconstruction between 1969 and 1975. It is one of the main tourist attractions in<br/> Armenia and the central shrine of Armenian neopaganism.</li>
